ObjectivelyRadicalScheduler
===========================

A simple C# scheduler designed for implementing simple coroutines in applications and games.  Multiple simultaneous coroutines that can take multiple arguments are supported.  Scripts can be paused for set intervals of time or can wait for a specific signal sent through the scheduler.  Optionally, running scripts can be assigned tags, and the scheduler can pause, resume and abort coroutines by tag as well.


Please see ORG.Scheduler/Example.cs for usage examples.
